The Hospital Management System is designed to streamline the administrative, clinical, and operational functions of a healthcare facility. It aims to improve efficiency, enhance patient care, and simplify the management of medical records, staff information, and inventory.
Features
1.	Patient Management: Allows registration, admission, discharge, and billing of patients. It also maintains medical records and prescription details.
2.	Doctor Management: Enables the management of doctor information, including specialization, schedule, and patient prescription.
3.	Receptionist Interface: Facilitates patient appointments, registration, and query handling.
4.	Nurse Management: Provides functionality for assigning nurses to patients, recording vital signs, and managing patient care.
5.	Store Manager Module: Manages inventory, orders, and supplies for the hospital.
6.	Access Control: Implements role-based access control to ensure data security and privacy.
7.	User-Friendly Interface: Features an intuitive user interface with menus, prompts, and error handling for ease of use.
8.	Web-Based Application: The system will be developed as a website with a backend and frontend for a seamless user experience.
9.	Flask-Based UI: The backend will be powered by Flask, allowing smooth interaction between the database and the user interface.
Proposal Overview
The proposed Hospital Management System is a comprehensive software solution developed in python (Flask) to address the diverse needs of modern healthcare facilities. The system incorporates modules for managing patient records, doctor appointments, staff information, inventory control, and more. It provides an intuitive user interface for different stakeholders, including administrators, doctors, receptionists, nurses, and store managers. The system will be developed as a web-based platform with a dynamic backend and a responsive frontend.
